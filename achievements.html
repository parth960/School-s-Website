    <p>Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, 
        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,<br>Latin professor at 
        Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure from a 
        Lorem Ipsum passage.</p>
